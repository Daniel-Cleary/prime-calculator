b.out executes the code

primeNumberCalculator.cpp contains the code

This program uses a recursive function to calculate prime numbers from zero to the given range. Because all composite numbers are products of prime numbers (assuming we keep to only positive integers), if a number isn't divisible by any of the prime numbers that come before it, then it is prime. Therefore, we can use previous prime numbers to calculate the next prime numbers. This is a speedy method of finding smaller prime numbers, but as the program runs on, it takes longer and longer for the program to cycle through all the primes.
